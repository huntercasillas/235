You will create your own hash map between a string and a vector of strings to implement the application from lab 3 
(Map that output text like a document).  

The following requirements will apply to this lab:
You create a O(1) implementation of a hashmap for adding and searching for strings in a the container.

Create a O(n) implementation using a STL vector of strings for the storage of the keys 
and a STL vector of vectors for storage of the values.  

Use a sequential search through the vector to find the index of the key and then use that index to look up 
the vector of context strings at that same index.

Compare the performance of your hashmap with the vector implementation.
